Run `dune build` in this directory to compile the project. It will compile the Coq code and generate OCaml code

Schulze method, run `dune exec _build/default/executable/shortestpath/main.exe` to run the shortest path code, 
run `dune exec executable/widestpathcode/main.exe` to run the shortest-widest path algorithm, etc.
